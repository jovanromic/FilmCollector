recls 100% .NET 1.100 Known Issues:
-----------------------------------

 * The current version does not support the specification of sub-directories
   as part of the patterns parameter. For example, with the C/C++ version of
	 recls (see http://www.recls.org/), you can search for .DLL files in
	 C:\Windows\System and .EXE files in in C:\Windows\System32, you may
	 specify a search directory/patterns as follows:

    Recls_Search("C:\\Windows", "System\\*.dll|System32\\*.exe", ...)

   With recls 100% .NET, you might expect to be able to follow similar
	 semantics, as in:

	   FileSearcher.Search(@"C:\Windows", @"System\*.dll|System32\*.exe")

	 The current version of recls 100% .NET does not support this. Instead,
	 you will have to conduct two separate searches, as in:

	   FileSearcher.Search(@"C:\Windows\System", @"*.dll")

	   FileSearcher.Search(@"C:\Windows32", @"*.exe")

   A later version will add this support. (If you wish to sponsor the
	 introduction of this functionality, look at the donation information in
	 the PLEASE_DONATE.txt file in this package.)


	 NOTE: Multipart patterns that do not contain sub-directories *are*
	 supported in recls 100% .NET, as in:


	   FileSearcher.Search(@"C:\Windows", @"*.dll|*.exe")
